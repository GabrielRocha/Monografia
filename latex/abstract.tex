\noindent This work suggests a proposal to implement a files and printers sharing server and a domain controller in an educational institution, with mission to facilitate the sharing of available network
resources, making safer and reliable the control of user’s access to these resources. More specifically, this work implements the open source Samba, in versions 3 and 4, as a free alternative to 
proprietary solutions such as Microsoft Active Directory, serving the resources above both Windows and Linux clients. Will also be presented basic concepts for the understanding of the tools 
used in addition to step-by-step instructions and scripts needed to carry out the implementation of the entire structure proposed in this work.\\
